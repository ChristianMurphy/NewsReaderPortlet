## About the News Reader Portlet

The original version of NewsReaderPortlet was written by Anthony Colebourne of University of Manchester.
and that portlet was heavily based upon the CalendarPortlet written by Jen Bourey of Yale University
(with permission).

## Configuration Options

### Disable Help Link

Setting the `allowHelp` portlet preference to `false` will disable the Help link in the portlet.  (The default is `true`.)  It may be necessary to edit the `portlet-definition.xml` file and re-import to make this change.
